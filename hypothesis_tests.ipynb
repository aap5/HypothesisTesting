This value seems a bit low, right? How do you think our class average in Data Science DISCOVERY compares to this? It might be less than 6.8, or it may be more than that. Let's find out if the ideal hours of sleep STAT107 students would get is significantly different from the average amount of sleep that all Americans get reported by Gallup. For the sake of this lab, assume our survey data is a random sample from the population (Americans).\n",

    "Over the summer, you get an internship for a high school summer baseball league. In this league, there are four different levels for each age group. The levels (in descending order) are the Invite, the Elite, the Select, and the Enlist. As you start the last few days of your internship, your supervisor asks to see you. He asks a favor of you before you leave. Each year, the winner of each level below Invite may petition the league to move up to the next highest level for next summer. All of the petitions but one have been approved or denied. Their statistics intern left already and forgot to look over the last petition. They are on a family vacation before the semester starts, so your supervisor cannot get ahold of them. You had once mentioned you took a statistics course, so your supervisor asks for help. He has gone through the petition. However, before making the final decision, he wants to know if the team’s batting average is statistically different from the Select’s overall. He knows a hypothesis test is required, but does not remember how to perform it. Fortunately, you still have VS Code and Python installed on your laptop."
